We’re also going to add an article tag, which is the tag specifically for blog posts and news articles. Using the familiar < p > tag, we’re going to place a few paragraphs of ‘lorem ipsum’.Lorem Ipsum is bunch of Latin that doesn’t actually mean anything, but allows you to fill something with text and stylize it later without having to worry about doing any writing.
